      <h2>P2P fitness blockchain marketplace based on collective experience</h2>
      <p>Collective experience envisages a chain of recursive NFTs, created out of a workout/meal plan and the history
        of its usage. The marketplace allows fitness trainers to mint their workout/meal plans as NFTs. Users can buy
        these NFTs, and mint out of them new NFTs, by adding usage experience, and resell them</p>
